**Is your feature request related to a problem?**
Currently, users need to manually initiate each scan individually, which is time-consuming for multiple documents.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Add a batch scanning mode that allows users to:
- Set the number of pages to scan
- Automatically scan multiple pages
- Save all scans in a single PDF or separate files
- Preview batch results before saving

**Additional context**
This will significantly improve productivity for users who need to scan multiple documents regularly.
